##  Contact Form

Powered by **FormSubmit**. To use it:

* Make sure your email is set correctly in the form action or fetch URL.
* Test it live (wonâ€™t work on `file://` or localhost directly without backend or AJAX).

##  Responsive Design

Mobile layout is optimized using media queries. On small screens, the sections stack vertically, and images and buttons are rearranged for best readability.

##  Credits

* ScrollReveal for animations
* Boxicons and Font Awesome for icons
* FormSubmit for contact handling
